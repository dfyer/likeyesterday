# Like Yesterday

Want to build a app that reports

1. ("NOW WORKING" In the morning,) TODAY's weather respect to YESTERDAY's weather.
2. (In the evening,) TOMORROW's weather respect to TODAY's weather.

## To Do

1. Decide the form of the report (temperature difference? che-gam-on-do? etc.)
2. Select the criteria for the report from (1)
3. Implement the logic
4. Decide frontend design.
5. Figure out which type of validation will suit (insight? tester?)
